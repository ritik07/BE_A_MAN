    <h1>Privacy Notice</h1>
    <p>Effective Date: October 19, 2020</p>
    <p>This Privacy Notice explains how Zelos Gaming, Inc. (“<strong>Zelos</strong>”, “<strong>we</strong>”, “<strong>us</strong>” or “<strong>our</strong>”) collects, uses, discloses, and otherwise processes Personal Information (as defined below) in connection with our website (the “<strong>Site</strong>”) and the related content, platform, services, and other functionality offered on or through the online services (collectively, the “<strong>Services</strong>”). It does not address our privacy practices relating to job applicants, employees and other personnel.</p>
    <h2>What is Personal Information?</h2>
    <p>When we use the term “<strong>Personal Information</strong>” in this Privacy Notice, we mean information that identifies, relates to, describes, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, to an individual. It does not include aggregated or deidentified information that is maintained in a form that is not reasonably capable of being associated with or linked to an individual.</p>
    <h2>Our Collection of Personal Information</h2>
    <p>Sometimes we collect Personal Information automatically when an individual interacts with our Services and sometimes, we collect the Personal Information directly from an individual. At times, we may collect Personal Information about an individual from other sources and third parties, even before our first direct interaction.</p>
    <h3>Personal Information Collected from Site Visitors and Account Holders</h3>
    <p>We collect the following Personal Information submitted to us by visitors to our Site and account holders:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Contact Information</strong>, including email address, phone number and communication preferences.</li>
      <li><strong>Inquiry Information</strong>, including information provided in custom messages sent through the forms or contact information provided on our Site.</li>
      <li><strong>Account Information</strong>, including email address, username and password, profile information, payment and purchase history information, and any other information you provided to us. Please note we utilize a third-party provider to process payments on our behalf and do not accept payment directly through our Site.</li>
      <li><strong>Gaming Information,</strong> including any information related to the games and third-party accounts that you link to our services, such as username and password for the third-party services, any raffles you partake in, and any other information you submit to us.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Personal Information Automatically Collected</h3>
    <p>As is true of most digital platforms, we and our third-party providers may also collect Personal Information from an individual’s device, browsing actions and site usage patterns automatically when visiting or interacting with our Site, which may include <strong>log data</strong> (such as internet protocol (IP) address, operating system, browser type, browser id, the URL entered and the referring page/campaign, date/time of visit, the time spent on our Site and any errors that may occur during the visit to our Site), <strong>analytics data</strong> (such as the electronic path taken to our Site, through our Site and when exiting our Site, as well as usage and activity on our Site) and <strong>location data</strong> (such as general geographic location based on the log data we or our third-party providers collect).</p>
    <p>We and our third-party providers may use (i) cookies or small data files that are stored on an individual’s computer and (ii) other, related technologies, such as web beacons, pixels, embedded scripts, location-identifying technologies and logging technologies (collectively, “<strong>cookies</strong>”) to automatically collect this Personal Information. For example, our Site uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. (“<strong>Google</strong>”), to collect and view reports about the traffic on our Site. More information about the use of Google Analytics for these analytical and non-advertising purposes can be obtained by visiting Google’s privacy policy <a href="http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners" target="_blank">here</a> and Google’s currently available opt-out options are available <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
    <p>To manage cookies, an individual may change their browser settings to: (i) notify them when they receive a cookie, so the individual can choose whether or not to accept it; (ii) disable existing cookies; or (iii) automatically reject cookies.  Please note that doing so may negatively impact an individual’s experience using our Site, as some features and offerings may not work properly or at all.  Depending on an individual’s device and operating system, the individual may not be able to delete or block all cookies. In addition, if an individual wants to reject cookies across all browsers and devices, the individual will need to do so on each browser on each device they actively use. An individual may also set their email options to prevent the automatic downloading of images that may contain technologies that would allow us to know whether they have accessed our email and performed certain functions with it.</p>
    <h3>Personal Information from Third Parties</h3>
    <p>We also obtain Personal Information from third parties; which we often combine with Personal Information we collect either automatically or directly from an individual.</p>
    <p>We may receive the same categories of Personal Information as described above from the following third parties:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Gaming Services</strong>: When an individual connects their accounts from third-party gaming services, we may receive some information about individuals that they permit the gaming service to share with third parties, including username and password, user content and account information. The data we receive is dependent upon an individual’s privacy settings with the gaming service. Individuals should always review and, if necessary, adjust their privacy settings on third-party websites and gaming services before sharing information and/or linking or connecting them to other services.</li>
      <li><strong>Social Media</strong>: When an individual interacts with our Services through various social media networks, such as when someone “Likes” us on Facebook or follows us or shares our content on Discord, Facebook, Twitter, or other social networks, we may receive some information about individuals that they permit the social network to share with third parties. The data we receive is dependent upon an individual’s privacy settings with the social network.

      <li><strong>Publicly Available Sources</strong>: We collect Personal Information about individuals that we do not otherwise have, such as contact information, employment-related information, and interest-in-services information, from publicly available sources. We may combine this information with the information we collect from an individual directly. We use this information to contact individuals, to send advertising or promotional materials or to personalize our Services and to better understand the demographics of the individuals with whom we interact.</li>
